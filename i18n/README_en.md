The ICMC Processor is a project initiated by [PhD. Eduardo do Valle Sim√µes](http://lattes.cnpq.br/4055872056358293) to teach Computer Organization and Architecture to students at the [Institute of Mathematical and Computational Sciences (Instituto de Ci√™ncias Matem√°ticas e Computa√ß√£o Ôºç ICMC)](https://icmc.usp.br/institucional/quem-somos) of the University of S√£o Paulo, primarily through practical application.

The project allows for the prototyping of a processor (CPU) on [FPGA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array) boards. It implements a custom [assembly language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language) with which students can program an application ([games](/docs/biblioteca/jogos) are suggested) to be loaded directly into the primary memory (RAM) of the board and executed without the intermediation of an operating system. The aim is for students to gain an understanding of general aspects of CPU operation, both in its logical and implementation terms.
